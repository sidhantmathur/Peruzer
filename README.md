This project is a WIP. It is meant to be a website that will allow one to take a simple quiz to find which product/service/activity is best for them.

The idea is to be able to answer 12 questions about what you need in a car and immediately getting a list of all the cars that match your demands. 

Simplify researching for the products you need. 

Users will be able to create their own quizzes, and add data to databases via a wiki like system. 

I will create curated surveys for people to use.
